Allow your horse at least 2 hours a day of free movement in a paddock or field sufficiently large for a quick gallop, a buck and a kick.\n\n- Horses need sufficient rest. Even though they often take a nap while standing up, they also need access to a resting place with a dry, clean and soft surface to lie down on.\n\n- Horses are herd animals, so social contact with other horses is an absolute must. Not just in the field or paddock, but also in the stable. You might want to use bars as stable dividers or allow horses to see each other by leaving top half of the stable door open.\n\n- Being able to see outside is also really important to your horse. That’s because observing what’s happening around him is part of his natural behavior.\n\n- An accident can happen before you know it. So try and prevent your horse from losing his footing on a slippery surface, or injuring himself on sharp or protruding objects.  In short: think about the safety of your horse!",
